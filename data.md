The digital platform enabling Kenyan citizens, residents and visitors to access government services online.

## A case study on eCitizen Kenya

Information Communication Technology (ICT) can make a valuable contribution towards the operations of and the services offered to citizens by a Government.

With itâs conception, Kenyaâs long -term development blueprint  - Vision 2030 - aimed to transform Kenya into a globally competitive and prosperous nation providing a high quality of life to its citizens.

A master Plan based on Vision 2030 envisaged the country as an ICT hub and a globally competitive digital economy.

The strategies to achieve this laid out in the masterplan included e-Government services, which would ensure the provision of e-Government information and services as key to improving productivity, efficiency, effectiveness and governance in all key sectors. This is how eCitizen was born.

Pesaflow and its Partners played a key role in the successful digitalization of the Republic of Kenyaâs government services through the implementation of the eCitizen platform which was developed by our individual founder engineers and which we have continued to maintain and support to date.
